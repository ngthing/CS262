Lab TA : Mohammad Rezaeirad                                             Lab Section : 209

The questions on this sheet should be answered as you progress through Lab 6. They are given in the original order of the main Lab 6 document. Use the original documentation for Lab 6, but write the answers to the questions on this sheet. You will turn in a soft-copy of this sheet as part of your lab submission. Therefore, you may wish to copy and paste this answer sheet to an ASCII text editor, write your answers directly into the editor, and then save the file. NOTE: Do not use any non-ASCII file formats (like Word or ODS format).

It is important that you follow this narrative carefully, and avoid any shortcuts in this lab. The answers to many of the questions you will be given depend upon properly completing the lab in the sequence presented.

Note: This lab must be completed on zeus using the cc compiler. The gnu compiler or compilers on other systems (Mason, Microsoft Visual C++ or XCode) may not give the same results. The TA will be looking for specific answers for the grading of this lab and the use of other compilers may result in incorrect answers.

Step #1:

How many errors appear? _5__
How many warnings appear?_1___

Step #2:

Step #3:
Run the program, and at the prompt, enter the value 10.
What happens? __Segmentation fault: core dumped___________

What value is printed after The sum of integers 0 to 10 is:  ? __10____
What value *should* have been printed? ___55___

Step #4:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? _1____
List in order the values output by the printf statement you added: _i = 10 sum = 10__

Answer the following questions again, based on the most recent code execution:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? ____1_______
List the values output by the printf statement you added: __i = 10 sum = 10__________________
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? ____10____

Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input). Did the warning message go away? __yes_____

Now answer the following questions:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? __1___
List the values output by the printf statement you added: ________i = 10 sum = 10____________
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? ___10_____

Comment out the for loop, and copy it to the line below, this time without the semicolon.
Compile and run the program again (using 10 as input). Now answer the questions:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? ___10__
List the values output by the printf statement you added: 
i=0 sum = 0
i=1 sum = 1
i=2 sum = 2
i=3 sum = 3
i=4 sum = 4
i=5 sum = 5
i=6 sum = 6
i=7 sum = 7
i=8 sum = 8
i=9 sum = 9


What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? __45______
Is the final value of sum correct? (Look at your answer to step #3 above) _no________

You are supposed to add the integers from 0 to 10. Which integer is missing? ___10_____

Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input):
Answer the following questions:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? __11___
List the values output by the printf statement you added: 
i=0 sum = 0
i=1 sum = 1
i=2 sum = 2
i=3 sum = 3
i=4 sum = 4
i=5 sum = 5
i=6 sum = 6
i=7 sum = 7
i=8 sum = 8
i=9 sum = 9
i=10 sum = 10

What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? __55______

Step #5:
Recompile, and run the code. Has the output changed? ____no_______

Step #6:
Create a directory named Lab6_<username>_<labsection>
Place a copy of your revised lab6.c (containing the changes you made throughout the course of this lab) in this directory.
Create a text file containing the answers to the questions on your completed lab 6 question/answer sheet, and place it in this directory. NOTE: Do not use any non-ASCII file formats (like Word or ODS format).
Create a tarfile of this directory and submit it to Blackboard as Lab 6.
