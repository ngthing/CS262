If you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.

Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. 
And no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dream.

One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.

Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worse kind of suffering.

There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.

You have to take risks. We will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen.

Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.

Warren Buffett/Quotes

It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.
If you think about that, you'll do things differently.

Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.

Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.
Someone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.

It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.

Rule No.1: Never lose money. Rule No.2: Never forget rule No.1.

It's better to hang out with people better than you.
Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you'll drift in that direction.

You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong.

In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.

We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.
