If you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.

Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. 
And no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dream.

One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.

Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worse kind of suffering.

There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.

You have to take risks. We will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen.

Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.
